Our recommendations at the end of the Discovery come from need statements and a comparative analysis. We created a content model to drill deeper into the specific fields and formatting of information for suppliers to use when searching for contract opportunities.

## Need statements
We synthesized findings from the diary study into need statements in the voice of businesses to help make decisions and prioritize how to build or improve services. Consider these needs when improving procurement websites for businesses:
* I need to be able to narrow down opportunities to find ones relevant to me.
* I need to know if an opportunity is worth pursuing.
* I need to find the platform on my search engine.
* I need to understand the information.
* I need to pick up where I left off after an interruption.

## Fields to display and enable filtering on
We created a content model to drill down into relevant fields to display at different points in the businessâ€™s journey when finding a relevant contract, as well as the format the information should take. This model is a starting point, offering a hypothesis to focus prototyping and usability testing with businesses to ensure they meet the need statements. 

## Comparative analysis
We conducted a [comparative analysis] (master_pages/en/ComparativeAnalysisPublic.pdf) to see how different jurisdictions enable businesses to find contract opportunities. We found that the UK Contracts Finder and Digital Marketplace show ways to make it easier that can be replicated in Canada and elsewhere. This presentation provides more detailed design guidance for improving the experience of businesses looking for public sector opportunities.
