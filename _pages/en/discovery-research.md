The goal of Discovery was to identify how CDS and PSPC can build a single point of access for public sector procurement opportunities. To meet this objective, the team broke the problem down into four lines of investigation:

1. the context processes, and policies
2. The bussinesses that would use a single point of access (SPA)
3. the buyer organizations that build an SPA
4. where these lines of inquiry meet: a content and data model
