A single point of access (SPA) is required by [Article 19.6](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/19.aspx?lang=eng) in the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union. It requires that Canada publish “notices of intended procurement” from the public sector on one site by September 21, 2022. 

This includes opportunities from all three levels of government (federal, provincial and territorial, and municipal), as well those of publicly funded institutions in the health services, academic, and social services sectors. We use the term “buyer organizations” to refer to all these entities. 

While the SPA may be a requirement of CETA, it also presents an opportunity to address a key pain point for businesses at home - finding relevant contracts.
