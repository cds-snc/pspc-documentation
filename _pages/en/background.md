Public sector procurement supports each level of government in dialy operations and service delivery to Canadians, including funding to third-party organizations in academia, the health and social services sectors. Getting a full picture of the total dollar value of public sector procurement is tough, but as of 2015, the OECD estimates that general government procurement in Canada is approximately $267 billion, representing 13.44% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP). [^2]  

There are over 10,000 buyer organizations that procure goods, services, and construction for the public sector. While some of these buyer organizations post their contracts to provAs of 13 October, 2017, provincial and territorial procurement websites had approximately 4,000 open opportunities [^3] 

A single point of access (SPA) is required by [Article 19.6](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/19.aspx?lang=eng) in the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union. It requires that Canada publish “notices of intended procurement” from the public sector on one site by September 21, 2022. 

This includes opportunities from all three levels of government (federal, provincial and territorial, and municipal), as well those of publicly funded institutions in the academic, health and social services sectors. These public sector entities are what we refer to as “buyer organizations.” 

And while the SPA may be a requirement of CETA, based on research in Discovery, it also presents an opportunity to address a key pain point for businesses at home - finding relevant contracts quickly and easily.
